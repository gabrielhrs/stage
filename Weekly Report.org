* Journal
** Week 2 mar
*** Things Done
- Meeting with Marie, Martin and Stephan : some clarfications on the
  internship topic, statistical verification and the functioning of
  SimGrid. It was decided to proceed with the study of [1] and get
  more understanding of SimGrid. 
- Installed SimGrid and COSMOS.
- Read [1], [2], [3] and [4].
- Meeting with Benoît, Gabriel, Marie and Martin : clarification on
  COSMOS and statistical verification. It was decided to search for
  case studies that would use probabilities on models relevant for
  SimGrid. There was no consensus yet on which way to follow, that is,
  either to focus on performance evaluation or on using statistical
  inference to guide path exploration. 
*** Questions
- Where to introduce probabilities in SimGrid (schedule time/task cost)?
- How to connect COSMOS or a similar development with SimGrid?
- What will be the focus of the internship?
*** Work Planned
- Search for case studies in [5].
- Read the slides on SimGrid.
- Read [6].
** Week 9 mar
*** Things Done
- Reading of [6] and [5].
- Learnt about GSPNs. 
- Found case study in [7]
*** Questions
- Essentially the same of the previous week. 
*** Work Planned
- Find more appropriate case study.
- Get more familiar with SimGrid models. 
** Week 16 mar
*** Things Done
- Reunion with Marie, Martin and Stephan : It was decided to proceed
  the development of a campaign runner that would lunch
  severalexperiments in parallel. The experiment in itself would be a
  client server application in which each client would wait for a
  Poisson distributed interval and send a task for the server to
  compute.
- There was some clarification on how to introduce probabilities in
  SimGrid.
- Written functions to calculate Poisson intervals with the Boost
  libraries. 
- Started the model for the client and the campaign runner.
*** Questions
- Relevant case sudy using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
*** Work Planned
- Finish the model for the client.
- Finish the campaign runner.  
** Week 23 mar
*** Things Done
- A first version of the runner was written but had problems with
  forks and pipes. 
- Reunion with Marie and Martin : some clarification on how to solve
  the problems were presented by Gabriel.
*** Questions
- Relevant case study using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments? (SELECT) 
*** Work Planned
- Finish runner.
- Start implementation of statistical methods. 
** Week 30 mar
*** Things Done
- Problems with the runner were fixed. 
- Reunion with Marie and Stephan: I've decided to proceed with the
  statistical methods as in [8] to start with as me and Marie would
  examine other methods.
*** Questions
- Relevant case study using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments? (SELECT) 
*** Work Planned
- Implement methods concerning the statistical verification part.
** Week 6 apr
*** Things Done
- First implementation of methods in [8] and [9] (Chow and Robbins).
- There were some problems with the algorithms for the estimation of
  the sampling plan.
- Reunion with Marie and Stephan : try and find a new algorithm for
  the sampling plan. 
*** Questions
- Relevant case study using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments?
  (SELECT) 
*** Work Planed
- Finish and polish the funtions for the statistical verification
  part. 
- See about formulae input.
** Week 13 Apr
*** Things Done
- Finished first implementation of (Chow Robbins)
- First implementation of Confidence Interval (Central Limit Theorem).
*** Questions
- Relevant case study using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments?
  (SELECT) 
- Differences between what was described in [8] and the implementation?
*** Work Planned
- See about formulae input.
- Separate methods.
** Week 20 Apr
*** Things Done
- Separated the methods (SPRT/C&R/CI). 
- Saw about plotting possibilities. 
*** Questions
- Relevant case study using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments?
  (SELECT) 
- Differences between what was described in [8] and the implementation?
*** Work Planned
- See about formula input and its consequences.
- Establish an interface for communication with SimGrid models.
- Check the statistical methods for implementation mistakes. 
** Week 27 Apr
*** Things Done
- First implementation of a plot script for visualizing data with
  gnuplot. 
- Checked the algorithms for mistakes. 
- Meeting with Marie and Stephan: it was decided to have a simple
  implementation of a communication interface leaving most of the work
  for the CampaignRunner. We've discussed about the limitations of the
  methods (C&R specifically). 
*** Questions
- Relevant case study using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments?
  (SELECT) 
- Differences between what was described in [8] and the implementation?
*** Work Planned
- First implementation of a parser for formulae.
- Start writing about the statistical background theory.
- Find at least one case study.
