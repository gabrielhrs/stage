This file contains the weekly journal of activities for my master's
internship on statistical verification and developments thereof within
the context of SimGrid. The year is 2015.

** Week 2 mar
*** Things Done
- Meeting with Marie, Martin and Stephan : some clarfications on the
  internship topic, statistical verification and the functioning of
  SimGrid. It was decided to proceed with the study of [1] and get
  more understading on SimGrid. 
- Installed SimGrid and COSMOS.
- Read [1], [2], [3] and [4].
- Meeting with Benoît, Gabriel, Marie and Martin : clarification on
  COSMOS and statistical verification. It was decided to search for
  case studies that would use probabilities on models relevant for
  SimGrid. There was no consensus yet on which way to follow, that is,
  either to focus on performance evaluation or on using statistical
  inference to guide path exploration. 
*** Questions
- Where to introduce probabilities in SimGrid (schedule time/task cost)?
- How to connect COSMOS or a similar development with SimGrid?
- What will be the focus of the internship?
*** Work Planned
- Search for case studies in [5].
- Read the slides on SimGrid.
- Read [6].
** Week 9 mar
*** Things Done
- Reading of [6] and [5].
- Learnt about GSPNs. 
- Found case study in [7]
*** Questions
- Essentially the same of the previous week. 
*** Work Planned
- Find more appropriate case study.
- Get more familiar wtih SimGrid models. 
** Week 16 mar
*** Things Done
- Reunion with Marie, Martin and Stephan : It was decided to proceed
  the development of a camppaign runner that would lunch
  severalexperiments in parallel. The experiment in itself would be a
  client server application in which each client would wait for a
  Poisson distributed interval and send a task for the server to
  compute.
- There was some clarification on how to introduce probabilities in
  SimGrid.
- Written functions to calculate Poisson intervals with the Boost
  libraries. 
- Started the model for the client and the campaign runner.
*** Questions
- Relevant case sudy using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
*** Work Planned
- Finish the model for the client.
- Finish the campaign runner.  
** Week 23 mar
*** Things Done
- A first version of the runner was written but had problems with
  forks and pipes. 
- Reunion with Marie and Martin : some clarification on how to solve
  the problems were presented by Gabriel.
*** Questions
- Relevant case sudy using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments? (SELECT) 
*** Work Planned
- Finish runner.
- Start implementation of statistical methods. 
** Week 30 mar
*** Things Done
- Problems with the runner were fixed. 
- Reunion with Marie and Stephan: I've decided to proceed with the
  statistical methods as in [8] to start with as me and Marie would
  examine othe methods.
*** Questions
- Relevant case sudy using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments? (SELECT) 
*** Work Planned
- Implement methods concerning the statistical verification part.
** Week 6 apr
*** Things Done
- First implementation of methods in [8] and [9] (Chow Robbins).
- There were some problems with the algorithms for the estimation of
  the sampling plan.
- Reunion with Marie and Stephan : try and find a new algorithm for
  the sampling plan. 
*** Questions
- Relevant case sudy using probabilities that could be simulated with SimGrid?
- How to fully parallelize the execution of multiple experiments?
  (SELECT) 
*** Work Planed
- Finish and polish the funtions for the statistical verification
  part. 
- See about formulae input.
